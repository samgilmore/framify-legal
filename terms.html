  <h1>Framify Terms of Service</h1>
  <p>Effective Date: September 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Subscription</h2>
  <p>
    Framify offers three subscription plans: weekly, monthly, and annual. All
    plans unlock full access to the app. Payments are handled securely through
    Apple’s App Store infrastructure and Superwall. Your subscription is tied to
    your Apple ID and will remain active across devices associated with your
    account.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Content and Storage</h2>
  <p>
    Framify does not store your photos remotely. All data is saved locally on
    your device and optionally synced through iCloud. Framify stores two types
    of records:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Photos</strong> — metadata, frame settings, and a reference to
        the original image asset in your photo library.</li>
    <li><strong>Presets</strong> — saved frame style settings tied to your user
        account.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Framify does not copy or host your original photos. If you delete an image
    from your device, it will no longer be available inside the app.
  </p>

  <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
  <p>
    You are responsible for maintaining your subscription through the App Store.
    If your subscription expires, Framify may restrict access until it is
    renewed.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>
    Framify is provided “as is” without warranties of any kind. We are not
    responsible for data loss, device issues, or misuse of the app.
