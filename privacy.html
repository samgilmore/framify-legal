  <h1>Framify Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective Date: September 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>
    Framify does not collect or store personal data on external servers. All
    information remains on your device and may be backed up through iCloud if
    enabled.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Stored Records</h2>
  <p>
    The app stores only two kinds of records:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Photos</strong> — references to your image assets and their
        associated EXIF metadata plus applied frame styles.</li>
    <li><strong>Presets</strong> — your custom frame styling configurations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    Payments and subscriptions are managed by Apple’s App Store and Superwall.
    Framify does not process or store payment information.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Your Control</h2>
  <p>
    You can delete the app at any time, which removes all locally stored data.
    If you delete a photo from your device, Framify will no longer display it.
  </p>
